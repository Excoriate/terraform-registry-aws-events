    ## Example
    Examples of this module's usage are available in the [examples](./examples) folder.

    ```hcl
    {{ include "../../../examples/eventbridge/eventbridge-rule/basic/main.tf" }}
    ```

    Simple example of a basic implementation.
    ```hcl
    {{ include "../../../examples/eventbridge/eventbridge-rule/basic/config/fixtures.tfvars" }}
    ```

    Example where multiple event rules are created at once.
    ```hcl
    {{ include "../../../examples/eventbridge/eventbridge-rule/basic/config/fixtures-multiple.tfvars" }}
    ```

    Example where an event pattern is passed.
    ```hcl
    {{ include "../../../examples/eventbridge/eventbridge-rule/basic/config/fixtures-event-patterns.tfvars" }}
    ```

    For module composition, It's recommended to take a look at the module's `outputs` to understand what's available:
    ```hcl
    {{ include "outputs.tf" }}
    ```

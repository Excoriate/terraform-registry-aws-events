    * üöÄ **IAM policy**: IAM policy that will be created and attached to the IAM role.

    ## Example
    Examples of this module's usage are available in the [examples](./examples) folder.

    ```hcl
    {{ include "../../../examples/eventbridge/eventbridge-permissions/basic/main.tf" }}
    ```

    Simple example of a basic implementation.
    ```hcl
    {{ include "../../../examples/eventbridge/eventbridge-permissions/basic/fixtures/fixtures.tfvars" }}
    ```

    Example where lambda permissions are set, in order to invoke an AWS Lambda function.
    ```hcl
    {{ include "../../../examples/eventbridge/eventbridge-permissions/basic/fixtures/fixtures-permissions-lambda.tfvars" }}
    ```

    Example where custom IAM policy documents are passed.
    ```hcl
    {{ include "../../../examples/eventbridge/eventbridge-permissions/basic/fixtures/fixtures-custom-policies.tfvars" }}
    ```

    Example where custom policy ARNs are passed
    ```hcl
    {{ include "../../../examples/eventbridge/eventbridge-permissions/basic/fixtures/fixtures-attach-policies-arns.tfvars" }}
    ```

    For module composition, It's recommended to take a look at the module's `outputs` to understand what's available:
    ```hcl
    {{ include "outputs.tf" }}
    ```

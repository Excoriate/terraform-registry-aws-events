    {{ include "../../../examples/sns/sns-topic/basic/fixtures/fixtures.tfvars" }}
    ```

    Example where multiple event rules are created at once.
    ```hcl
    {{ include "../../../examples/sns/sns-topic/basic/fixtures/fixtures-with-custom-sns-topic-policy.tfvars" }}
    ```

    ```

    For module composition, It's recommended to take a look at the module's `outputs` to understand what's available:

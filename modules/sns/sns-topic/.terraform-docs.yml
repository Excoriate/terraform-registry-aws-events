    ## Example
    Examples of this module's usage are available in the [examples](./examples) folder.

    ```hcl
    {{ include "../../../examples/sns/sns-topic/basic/main.tf" }}
    ```

    Simple example of a basic implementation.
    ```hcl
    {{ include "../../../examples/sns/sns-topic/basic/fixtures/fixtures.tfvars" }}
